Hi, my name is Sambit! <span class="wave">ðŸ‘‹</span>

I currently work as an AI Engineer at the [MATRIX AI Consortium](https://ai.utsa.edu/) where I develop AI solutions to improve trauma care delivery for patients.
My research interests lie on the intersection of AI and medicine.

Previously, I completed a PhD in the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](http://www.bme.jhu.edu/) and [Institute of Computational Medicine](https://icm.jhu.edu/), at Johns Hopkins, where I had the pleasure working with Joshua T. Vogelstein in the [NeuroData lab](https://neurodata.io/).
I worked on developing methods for high-dimensional hypothesis testing, causal inference, and extensions of random forest, all of which are neatly wrapped in [software packages](/software/).
I also applied these methods to real data sets, including those from [Bert Vogelstein](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/bert-vogelstein) and the [Neurobehavioral Core at NIEHS](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/facilities/neurobehavioral/index.cfm).

I completed my master's degree (MSE) in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins in 2020. I was also an undergraduate at NC State in [Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.unc.edu/) and [Biology](https://bio.sciences.ncsu.edu/) while on the [Goodnight Scholarship](https://goodnight.ncsu.edu/). There, I worked with [Leslie Sombers](https://www.somberslab.org/), using electrochemistry to understand neural systems.

As a way to "pay it forward", I run the Ramchandara Panda Scholarship Competition, which provides scholarships to local students in my family's village in India and helps preserve local traditions for future generations.

In my free time, I like to read books and go on hikes!
