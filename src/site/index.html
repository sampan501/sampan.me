intro: |
    I'm an AI Engineer at the [MATRIX AI Consortium](https://ai.utsa.edu/) where I am developing a end-to-end solution for trauma care using AI.
    Previously, I did my PhD at [Johns Hopkins](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/academics/graduate/phd-program/), where I was advised by [Joshua T. Vogelstein](https://jovo.me/).
    Here's a little bit more [about me](/about/).
