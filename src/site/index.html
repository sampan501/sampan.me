intro: |
    I'm a PhD candidate at [Johns Hopkins](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/academics/graduate/phd-program/), where I am advised by [Joshua T. Vogelstein](https://jovo.me/) in the NeuroData lab. Most days, I
    develop and apply high-dimensional and nonlinear machine learning algorithms to answer interesting biomedical questions.
    Here's a little bit more [about me](/about/).
